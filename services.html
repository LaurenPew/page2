<h3>Cleaning</h3>
	<p>Here at the studio we take pride in our ability to clean shoes. Most places will restore the shoe or take away it's original build. We on the other hand do not. We do everythinhg in our power to keep the original shoe looking as fresh as we can.</p>
<h3>Restoring</h3>
	<p>If we are unable to clean the material of the shoe or it is to damaged we will do restoring. It's always sad to see the original shoe being lost but if we can keep it looking brand new thats what we are gonna do!</p>
<h3>Walk-ins</h3>
	<p>Most of the time we prefer that customers call in just so we have a heads up on what they need done or if we are to busy that day we could get them schedualed for later. However we do take walk-ins! This only applies if it is a minor fix or a simple cleaning. A full restoration will not be applicable for a walk-in.</p>
